# postgis-docker

Automated and up-to-date Docker images for all supported versions of PostgreSQL and PostGIS.

Images are based upon the [official Postgres images](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) but with PostGIS included. New versions of PostgreSQL and PostGIS should automatically be detected and trigger new docker images to built, tagged, and pushed by a daily [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/GUI/postgis-docker/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml).
